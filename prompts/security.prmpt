Security Review
Perform a security audit of this repository. Analyze the code for vulnerabilities and security anti-patterns:

1. **Injection Flaws** — SQL injection, command injection, XSS, template injection, path traversal.
2. **Authentication & Authorization** — Are auth mechanisms sound? Any bypasses? Hardcoded credentials?
3. **Secrets Management** — Any API keys, tokens, or passwords in code or config files?
4. **Input Validation** — Is user input validated and sanitized at trust boundaries?
5. **Cryptography** — Are crypto primitives used correctly? Any weak algorithms or hardcoded keys?
6. **Dependencies** — Known CVEs in dependencies? Pinned versions?
7. **Configuration** — Debug mode enabled? Verbose error messages exposed? CORS misconfigured?

Rate overall risk (Low / Medium / High / Critical) and list findings with severity, affected files, and recommended fixes. Flag any issues that need immediate attention.
